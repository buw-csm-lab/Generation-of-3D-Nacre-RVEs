### Contents

Two scripts are provided:
* `a01_Nacre_2D_RVE.m`: MatLab code for generating randomized layers of nacre (polygonal mineral
  platelets separated by a protein matrix) \
  geometry (size of RVE, layer thickness, matrix thickness, average platelet size) is parameterized
* `a02_Nacre_FULL_3D_RVE.py`: Python script to read in layer data and generate nacre representative volume element
    in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Abaqus</span> 


Additional functions for MatLab script are defined in .m files.
